Box Model Basics
=================

Understanding padding, borders, and margins all affects our content.
We can set the width and height - if we don't set the content will have 100% of its parent container. The height will be determinate by how much content there is. 

Inside out - container box <div>
- heading level element <h1>
- paragraph <p>
The base width of this box is determined by width of the parent element or explicit setting a width for this content box.
The height of the element unless specified it's going to be determinate by the amount of content that we have inside this box. 

In base width and height is defined by the content itself.

If we add padding - the box will be the content + padding.

If we add a border - box will be content + padding + border.

If we add a margin - box will be content + padding + border + margin.

Chrome and the Box Model

Each element is contain in their own box that can have borders and margins and paddings set for it

In Chrome click with the right bottom of the mouse and inspect. We can see all the different box models and in the right side if we set * { border: 1px solid red} we can see all the boxes.
