Box Model Basics
=================

Understanding padding, borders, and margins all affects our content.
We can set the width and height - if we don't set the content will have 100% of its parent container. The height will be determinate by how much content there is. 

Inside out - container box <div>
- heading level element <h1>
- paragraph <p>
The base width of this box is determined by width of the parent element or explicit setting a width for this content box.
The height of the element unless specified it's going to be determinate by the amount of content that we have inside this box. 

In base width and height is defined by the content itself.

If we add padding - the box will be the content + padding.

If we add a border - box will be content + padding + border.

If we add a margin - box will be content + padding + border + margin.

=========================
Chrome and the Box Model
=========================

Each element is contain in their own box that can have borders and margins and paddings set for it

In Chrome click with the right bottom of the mouse and inspect. We can see all the different box models and in the right side if we set * { border: 1px solid red} we can see all the boxes.

=================
Full-Width Boxes
=================

If we specify 100% width and add padding the final result will be more then 100% of the width.

==================
Boxes and Columns
==================

Any time we add padding or borders or margins we have to acount for the extra width wheatever we size the content itself. We have to make adjustment to the calculations to the width of the content for the default behaviour of the box model.  

=======================
Positioning and Floats
=======================

How absolute elements and fluid elements behave in a context of a box model.
When we change the position of an element and make it absolute the width of that box will only take the room as the content needs. If we float the box left or right it only takes what the box requires. 
This will change if we specify the width.

================
Inline Elements
================

How box model affects diferent types of elements.
Ex. <span>
Regardless how much padding we added the height will be determined by the line-height property. The vertical alignment is not affected by padding. The same happens to margin. 
Margins and padding affects the left and right edges of our inline elements.
